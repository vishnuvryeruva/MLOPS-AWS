MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It tackles four primary functions:
* Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (MLflow Tracking).
* Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data scientists or transfer to production (MLflow Projects).
* Managing and deploying models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models).
* Providing a central model store to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage transitions, and annotations (MLflow Model Registry).
* Proper monitoring of drift as well as skew as well verification/validation step(model blessing)
